We were approved by John Waite, the owner of the local game store(LGS) Merlyn's to improve the store's website for customers purchasing Magic: The Gathering cards for pickup. This is what the website looks like for customers attempting to purchase Magic cards: https://merlyns.biz/magic-the-gathering-cards. As an entrenched Magic player and several of the other team members are also knowledgeable about Magic the user experience is not friendly and could use some updating to current modern-day standards. 
These were the project goals we proposed to Mr. Waite,

Project goals:
* Simplify the process for finding cards in stock. This includes searching for cards by name(with auto-complete), color, type, card number, etc.
* Display the cards with images.
* A submission form for customers to directly email Merlyn's from the web page with the cards already populated in the email in the required Merlyn's format.
* Employees can continue working with the current Excel spreadsheets. They will not need training to use the new database.

These are the major things that we were looking to do for Mr. Waite. However, during the senior project/capstone process we could add or change some of the goals to improve the user experience and take into account what Mr. Waite would like to change or ask for improvements.
