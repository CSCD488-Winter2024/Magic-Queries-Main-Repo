# Team Magic Queries

## Our project is updating a local game store's (Merlyn's) card buying system.  

### We are going to improve Merlyn's store's website for customers purchasing Magic: The Gathering cards for pickup, currently their ordering system is inconvenient and requires a lot of unnecessary steps, it needs to be updated to current, modern-day standards which will improve business and customer interactions. 

## Installation

### Prerequisites

  - Astro extension
  - Tailwind CSS IntelliSense extension

### Installation Steps

In the terminal:

  - Change working directory to magic-queries by typing: cd /workspaces/Magic-Queries-Main-Repo/magic-queries
  - Type "npm install"
  - Type "npm install astro"

## Functionality

Use the search bar to lookup cards by name, this is using the Scryfall API. We are working on linking the game store inventory sheets to the information that comes from Scryfall. Right now this search page will display results from all magic cards, in the near future it will only display cards in stock at Merlyn's
