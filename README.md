# Team Magic Queries

## Our project is updating a local game store's (Merlyn's) card buying system.  

### We are going to improve Merlyn's store's website for customers purchasing Magic: The Gathering cards for pickup, currently their ordering system is inconvenient and requires a lot of unnecessary steps, it needs to be updated to current, modern-day standards which will improve business and customer interactions. 

Project Goals:

  * Simplify the process for finding cards in stock. This includes searching for cards by name(with auto-complete), color, type, card number, etc.
  * Display the cards with images.
  * A submission form for customers to directly email Merlyn's from the web page with the cards already populated in the email in the required Merlyn's format.
  * Employees can continue working with the current inventory spreadsheets.

These are the major things that we are looking to do for Mr. Waite. However, during the senior project/capstone process we could add or change some of the goals to improve the user experience and take into account what Mr. Waite would like to change or ask for improvements.

## Functionality

Use the search bar to lookup cards by name, this is using the Scryfall API. We are working on linking the game store inventory sheets to the information that comes from Scryfall. Right now this search page will display results from all magic cards, in the near future it will only display cards in stock at Merlyn's
